          <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Lorem Ipsum</span> is simply dummy text of the printing and
            typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
            dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
            galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
            survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
            typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
            the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
            passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
            Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

          <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
          <p>
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by
            the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point
            of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
            distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content
            here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing
            packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default
            model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web
            sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the
            years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour
            and the like).
